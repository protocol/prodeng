# Production Engineering

The Production Engineering teamâ€™s mission is to drive improvements in existing Protocol Labs software to enable it to better operate at scale.
    
We work with protocol development teams (Stewards, community), infrastructure engineering teams (such as NetOps), research engineers, and PL partners to champion and improve the Performance, Scalability, Security, Observability, and Reliability posture of decentralized Web3 protocols such as IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin, and Drand.

Read more about the team on our [public Notion page](https://www.notion.so/pl-strflt/ProdEng-f8b30780202246a889d1335205664b29).

We manage our work via epic style issues in this repository but most of the work undertaken is covered by issues in the repository of the technology or application we are working on. Our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/protocol/projects/17/views/2) gives a view of the high level epic planning.
